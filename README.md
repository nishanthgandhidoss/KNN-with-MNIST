# KNN-with-MNIST
Machine Learning course assignment for KNN classification - This repository gives an complete overview of KNN algorithm with its benefits and shortcomings using the famous MNIST dataset. 

Many methods such as Leave One out cross validation, summing, binning, max and min pooling are tried to make the accuracy better.

Optimzation in the prediction time and training time is done by creating look up table of distances between the data points in space.
